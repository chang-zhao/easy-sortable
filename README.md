# easy-sortable
Simple fast vertical sortable plugin. It allows dragging between several lists.

# What & Why
The simplest possible sortable plugin for modern browsers, fast and responsive.
No lags, no stuttering.

It uses jQuery for bindung & DOM manipulations, and CSS3 transitions for animations.

In a further development, I think to:

^ convert from jQuery to pure JS as much as possible.

# Usage
* All the draggable elements should be placed vertically. They can be DIV, P, LI, SPAN etc. They shoul have class="drag".
* All the draggable elements should be siblings (children of the same container). A container could be DIV, OL, UL etc.
* In that container, any other children elements may be present, not draggable by themselves. They can be used to separate a container space into several lists.
