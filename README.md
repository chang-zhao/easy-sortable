# easy-sortable
Simple fast vertical sortable plugin

## What & Why
This is intended to be a fast and responsive plugin for modern browsers.
In the further development, I think to:
- disconnect the moving object from inside the container, to increase smoothness;
- change jQuery animations to CSS3 transitions;
- optimize further, by collecting all the needed info on draggable elements on mousedown, so there will be no need to call much jQuery on mousemove;
- convert from jQuery to pure JS as much as possible.
