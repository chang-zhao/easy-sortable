# easy-sortable
Simple sortable plugin.

# What & Why
* The simplest possible sortable plugin for modern browsers.
* Fast and responsive. No lags, no stuttering.
* Allows dragging between several lists. (Only vertical dragging).

It uses jQuery for bindung & DOM manipulations, and CSS3 transitions for animations.

In a further development, I think to:

^ convert from jQuery to pure JS as much as possible.

# Usage
* All the draggable elements should be placed vertically. They can be DIV, P, LI, SPAN etc. They shoul have class="drag".
* All the draggable elements of a list (or of a united group of lists) should be siblings (children of the same parent container). That container could be DIV, OL, UL etc.
* In that container, any other children elements may be present, not draggable by themselves. They can be used to separate a container space into several lists.
* See examples (HTML files of this repository).
